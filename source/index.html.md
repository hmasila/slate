# Introduction

```ruby

# Use rubygems

gem install auth-armor


# Or use bundler

gem 'auth-armor'


# Then require the gem.

require 'auth-armor'
```

Auth Armor turns smart mobile devices into modern secure authenticators preventing attacks and un-authorized access.

Passwords and shared secrets are outdated and insecure. Account take-overs, password theft and breaches cost billions each year and are getting worse.

Use Auth Armor to protect websites, apps, backoffice and more with our simple API. Get running in minutes.

# Authorization

To obtain an Access token, you must make a request to the Auth Armor OAuth2 server using the client_credentials OAuth2 grant.

> Request

```shell
curl -X POST 
-d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
https://login.autharmor.com/connect/token
```

```ruby
require "auth-armor"
AuthArmor::Client.new(client_id: "CLIENT_ID", client_secret: "CLIENT_SECRET")

```

```php 
<?php
  // Place your credentials in autharmor_creds.php. File should contain the following 3 lines:
  $this->client_id = "YourClientID";
  $this->client_secret = "YourClientSecret";
?>
```


| Param | Required | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | 
| client_id | Yes | Client ID from Auth Armor |
| client_secret | Yes | Client Secret from Auth Armor |
| scope | No | Permissions that the token will be allowed to perform |


> Response

```json
{
  "access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1N...",
  "expires_in":600,
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "scope":"aarmor.api.generate_invite_code aarmor.api.request_auth"
}
```

## API Access

Both the `client_id` and `client_secret` are obtained via the developer dashboard located at [https://dashboard.autharmor.com](https://dashboard.autharmor.com)

Login then select or create a project. Navigate to the Api Access section and create a new api client. when you create a client, you are asked to give the client permissions, or scopes; select one more more scopes here. Please see the scopes section for more info. After client creation, you will be presented with a `client_id` and `client_secret`. Copy these values into your request.

## Scopes

Scopes are permissions that the token will be allowed to perform. There are two scopes allowed. They are `aarmor.api.generate_invite_code` and `aarmor.api.request_auth`. When you create an api access client, you will be asked to select what scopes the client is allowed to perform. When requesting a token using that client, you can optionally leave the scope field blank. If left blank, all of the scopes that are assigned to the client will be applied to the token. If you specify the scopes in the token request, the token will then only have the scopes that were requested.

The access token returned will be used as a Bearer token for all the other requests.

# Send Invite

> Request

```shell

curl -XPOST
-H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
-H "Content-type: application/json"
-d '{
  "nickname": "john_doe",
  "reference_id": "123456789"
}'
'https://api.autharmor.com/invite/request'

```


```ruby
AuthArmor::Client.invite_request(
  nickname: "NICKNAME"
)
```

```php
<php
  AuthArmor->invite_request(nickname: "NICKNAME")
?>
```

Before you can send auth requests, you must invite users to your project. You can use the invite API to request an invite, then send to your users. Auth Armor supports two ways users can be invited. Either methods first needs a call to the Auth Armor invite API

| Param | Required | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | 
| nickname | Yes |  This is a friendly display name for your user. It would be best to set the nickname to the username value or something similar so you can relate to your system. If your usernames are email addresses, consider masking the email address before using as a nickname to avoid personal information being stored in Auth Armor. You can search history using this ID |
| reference_id | No | This is an optional value that you can set to further cross reference your records. For example, you could set this value to your unique value in your system such as a UUID, a row ID, or some other value. You can search history using this ID. |

## QR code

```ruby
AuthArmor::Client.generate_qr_code

```

> Example

To use the QR code format, please format a json payload like below:

``` json
{
  "type":"profile_invite",
  "version":1,
  "format_id":1,
  "payload": {
    "aa_sig": "AA_SIG",
    "invite_code":"INVITE_CODE"
  }
}
```

A QR code can be generated and then scanned, much like many of the other authenticators out there. In the app, a user simply needs to scan the QR code to get setup for your project.



Then generate a QR code using this payload text. The QR code can then be scannedin the app

## Invite link

```ruby
AuthArmor::Client.get_invite_link
```

> Example

> `https://invite.autharmor.com/?i=aacc137b-e13e-4f35-9d3b-402d530d954c&aa_sig=6036145BEB43D02F61F5D41CE43F8BA5858ECBC2ED4AA7F35C8176BE37B92E68`

In this method, the user can either click a link and follow invite instructions, or by using our client SDK, you can open a small pop-up window that will drive the invite process.

Invite Link format:

`https://invite.autharmor.com/?i=INVITE_CODE>&aa_sig=AA_SIG`

# Push Request

This is the API Endpoint to use for sending an auth request to your user(s).

```shell

curl -XPOST
-H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
-H "Content-type: application/json"
-d '{
  "nickname": "sample_user",
  "action_name": "Login",
  "short_msg": "Login requested detected from IP: 192.160.0.1",
  "nonce": "some unique value of your choice here"
  }'
'https://api.autharmor.com/auth/request'

```


```ruby
AuthArmor::Client.auth_request(
  nickname: "sample_user",
  action_name: "Login",
  short_msg: "This is a test message",
  nonce: "some unique value of your choice here"
)
```

```php
<?php
  AuthArmor->auth_request(
    nickname: "sample_user",
    action_name: "Login",
    short_msg: "This is a test message",
    nonce: "some unique value of your choice here"
  )
?>
```


| Param | Required | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | 
| nickname | Yes |  The nickname for the user you want to send this auth request to. |
| action_name | Yes | This is the action name that shows up in the push notification. This is the action the user is approving. Examples: “Login”, “Money Transfer”, “Account update”, etc. The min length is 2, and the max length is 25. |
| short_message | Yes |  This is the short message that will appear in the app under the action name. |
| nonce | No |  An optional value that is signed and returned in the request. This helps validate the response was from your request and no one has done a man-in-the-middle attack. |
| timeout_in_seconds | No | This is the amount of time you want to allow the auth to be valid before it expires. The min is 15, and max is 300. This is optional, and if not provided, will use the default time for the project. |
| accepted_auth_methods | No |  This is an optional field. If you do not send it, Auth Armor will allow any type of auth method, including biometric, security key or even pin fall back from non-biometric devices. |
| origin_location_data | No |  You can specify location data in the format of latitude and longitude. If provided, location details will show in the push message about the origin of the request. |

If you send `accepted_auth_methods` param, you must provide a rule to go along with it. The accepted auth methods currently supported are: `mobileDevice` and `securityKey`.

## Mobile Device

> Using Mobile Device

```shell

curl -XPOST
-H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
-H "Content-type: application/json"
-d '{
  "nickname": "sample_user",
  "action_name": "Login",
  "short_msg": "Login requested detected from IP: 192.160.0.1",
  "nonce": "some unique value of your choice here",
  "timeout_in_seconds": "120",
  "accepted_auth_methods": [
      {
        "name": "mobiledevice",      
        "rules": [
          {
            "name": "forcebiometric",
            "value": "true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
'https://api.autharmor.com/auth/request'

```

```ruby
AuthArmor::Client.auth_request(
  nickname: "sample_user",
  action_name: "Login",
  short_msg: "This is a test message",
  nonce: "some unique value of your choice here",
  accepted_auth_methods: "mobiledevice",
  forcebiometric: true
)
```

```php
<?php
  AuthArmor->auth_request(
    nickname: "sample_user",
    action_name: "Login",
    short_msg: "This is a test message",
    nonce: "some unique value of your choice here",
    accepted_auth_methods: [{
      "name": "mobiledevice",
      "rules": {
        "name": "forcebiometric",
        "value": true
      }
    }]
  )
?>
```

The current rules for mobileDevice are `forceBiometirc`. This can either be set to true or false.

If `forceBiometric` is set to true, a mobile device will be required and biometrics will be required. Pin fallback and non-biometric devices will not be compatible with this method. Only biometrics, such as fingerprint or faceID will be allowed. 

If `forcebiometric` is set to false, then a mobile device must be used, and a security key will not be allowed. Pin fallback and non-biometric devices using a pin will also be allowed

## Security Key

> Using Security Key

```shell

curl -XPOST
-H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
-H "Content-type: application/json"
-d '{
  "nickname": "sample_user",
  "action_name": "Login",
  "short_msg": "Login requested detected from IP: 192.160.0.1",
  "nonce": "some unique value of your choice here",
  "timeout_in_seconds": "120",
  "accepted_auth_methods": [
      {
        "name": "securitykey"     
      }
    ]
  }'
'https://api.autharmor.com/auth/request'

```

```ruby
AuthArmor::Client.auth_request(
  nickname: "sample_user",
  action_name: "Login",
  short_msg: "This is a test message",
  nonce: "some unique value of your choice here",
  accepted_auth_methods: "securitykey"
)
```

```php
<?php
  AuthArmor->auth_request(
    nickname: "sample_user",
  action_name: "Login",
  short_msg: "This is a test message",
  nonce: "some unique value of your choice here",
    accepted_auth_methods: [{
      "name": "securitykey"
    }]
  )
?>
```

At this time, there are no rules for security keys.

If you set to security key, then mobile device will not be allowed, meaning no pin or biometrics are performed. Only a security key will be allowed. At this time, Auth Armor is using `U2F`. Full `FIOD2` with user presence is coming soon.
